#Pink It is a color. One can describe it as a shade on spectrum of reflected light not absorbed by an object lighter than red but not quite white or write it down in hexadecimal. Unfortunately whilst being an objective thing pink is subjectively experienced and no amount of poetry can truly capture the experience of pink. And to the human mind the thing and the experience of are indivisible if not equivalent.
