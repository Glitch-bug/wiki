#Pink 
It is a color. 
One can describe it as a shade on spectrum of reflected light not absorbed by an object lighter than red but not quite white or write it down in hexadecimal. 
Unfortunately whilst being an objective reality, the pink is subjectively experienced and hence no amount of poetry or great mastery of mathematics can truly capture and communicate the experience of pink and to the human mind the thing and the **experience** of are indivisible if not __equivalent__.
